/**
 * The message's user comes from the envelope (`sender_id`), and its display
 * name comes from the recipient's friend graph, never the payload (SPEC §0.5).
 *
 * Signal-aligned: the Envelope carries BOTH the sending user (source_service_id -> sender_id, a
 * routing/attribution HINT) and the sending device (source_device -> sender_device_id, which selects
 * the inbound Signal session). The recipient takes the user from sender_id and authenticates it via
 * the session (a valid MAC proves the sender's device). It looks up the display name in its own
 * friend graph keyed on that user id; it never trusts a name off the wire. The ONE exception is a
 * friend request — first contact, sender not yet in the graph — where the display name is the
 * legitimate FriendRequest.username payload bootstrap.
